# Music-Player-Project

A Music Player created using HTML and CSS as a frontend would be a web-based application designed to play music files.
The player would consist of a user interface that would display information about the music, such as the song title, artist, and album art. 
It would also provide controls for playing, pausing, skipping tracks, adjusting volume, and displaying the progress of the current track.

The layout of the music player would be designed using HTML and styled using CSS to create a visually appealing and functional interface.
The player could include a playlist feature that allows the user to create and manage playlists of their favorite songs.
The player could also include search and filtering features to allow the user to quickly find the desired song.

Overall, This  Music Player created using HTML and CSS as a frontend would be a versatile and 
customizable application that could provide a great user experience for music lovers.
